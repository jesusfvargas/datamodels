ArangoDB is an open-source database that follows a multi-model approach, supporting key-value, document, and graph data models. It uses a client/server hosting model and allows for horizontal scaling. To access ArangoDB from Java, you can use the official Java driver (https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb-java-driver), and for Python, you can use the python-arango driver (https://github.com/joowani/python-arango).
