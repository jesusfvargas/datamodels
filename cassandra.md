## Accessing Cassandra
Apache Cassandra is an open-source, highly-scalable, and distributed NoSQL database that follows a wide-column data 
model. It utilizes a client/server hosting model and is designed for high availability and fault tolerance. 

### Java developers can access Cassandra using the DataStax Java driver (https://github.com/datastax/java-driver), and 

### Python developers can use the DataStax Python driver (https://github.com/datastax/python-driver).
